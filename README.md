# Bike-ride-exploratory-analysis
case study project for google  professional certification

This project is based on case study for bike rides. The problem statement involved using previous 12 months data to get an understanding of usage of bike between casual users and membership users. The data was provided was internal data .

Tools used:
 In this project I have used tools like Jupyter notebook and R studio. Jupyter notebook is used for easier data loading and cleaning while R studio was used for getting insights from data using the data visualization library ggplot2.
 
I divided thid project into two parts:

1.Using Jupyter notebook: 
In this part I performed data cleaning and integrating data into one whole data frame. Jupyter was the tool of my choice for this project because the dataset was very large,by large i mean it had approximately 3 million rows.

2.Using R studio:
R studio was used to provide plostsfor visualizations.
